# NOTE
- Using Git LFS may have caused Tmux Plugin Manager to be unable to download this repo
  so the screenshots are not tracked in Git LFS unfortunately

# TODO
- [ ] add argparse to bars.py
    - [ ] handle input for cpu_percent period

# FUTURE
- [ ] add colors (maybe) like jdxcode did: https://github.com/jdxcode/tmux-cpu-info/
- [ ] add a very small space between bars to show usage per cpu (HairSpace was too big)
